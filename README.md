# DeepFakeDetection
Challange of kaggle was held by Google,AWS and Facebook
# Introduction
The Deepfake Detection Challenge is a Kag-gle competion hosted by AWS, Facebook, Mi-crosoft and the Partnership on AI’s Media In-tegrity Steering Committee with the purpose toenhance the research in the detection of deep-fakes and manipulated media (Kaggle, 2019).Started  in  December  2019  and  lasted  threemonths, it saw the participation of more than2000 teams from all over the world both fromacademia and industry.  One of the main con-tributions of this competition to the media ma-nipulation detection research area is the largedataset  of  real  and  fake  videos  that  is  nowavailable  to  the  research  community.Thisdataset is an improvement over other recentlyreleased ones for its data diversity, agreementfrom persons depicted in the videos and sizeof dataset,  among others.   During the courseof  the  competition  our  team  tried  several  so-lutions and run many experiments that led usto the the top 13% in the public leaderboard,but,  due  to  the  severe  overfitting  that  almostall the top teams faced over the public test set,we  only  reached  the  top  42%  in  the  privateleaderboard. Our final solution is an ensembleof three EfficientNetB7 and one Xception netthat detect the presence of manipulation in sin-gle frames of the videos, without any temporalinformation.  We leave the explanation of ourdesign choices to the following sections.
